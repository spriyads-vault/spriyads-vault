- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sathishka Priyad
- 👀 I’m interested in AI and Frontend Development. I have a strong passion for learning new things and exploring the vast possibilities that technology offers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning, diving deep into algorithms, data structures, and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with AI and Frontend Development. Whether it's building innovative web applications or exploring new AI technologies, I'm eager to work with like-minded individuals who are not afraid to think outside the box.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can get in touch with me at spriyad.infor@gmail.com for any collaborative projects, questions, or just to say hi!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: While I'm deeply immersed in the world of technology and AI by day, my off-screen passion lies in watching old vintage movies, especially those revolving around war and history. This hobby offers me a unique perspective on how far we've come, both technologically and socially, and provides a stark contrast to my daily work.
